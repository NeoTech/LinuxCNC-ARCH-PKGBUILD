This package requires the use of pyenv.
You need to compile it with python 2.7.18 active.

You need to install Yapps, globally using your system python pip
`pip install yapps`

When then switching environment it should take hold.
By doing `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` in the PKGBUILD folder you will
be able to switch into the locally selected python defined in .python_version.
